    <h4>Linux is a mainframe operating system that uses a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel, which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals, and file systems (Source:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux") Its costs can be between 25K and 30K.</h4>

        <i>Linux-based mainframes</i> are mainframes that come from a system machine. These machines allow <i>Linux</i> to work. Some popular <i>Linux operating systems</i> used include Z machines. <i>Linux mainframes</i> were created as an advanced model of the original IBM mainframe. One of the purposes of the <i>Linux operating system</i> is to create an easier and manageable (simple) operating system. <i>Linux</i> is a “cleaner” system version of mainframe that is structures to be organized and efficient (better optimization). They are run through virtual environments that keep them on the web so it is more accessible to others. These environments also allow <i>Linux</i> to “collaborate” with other operating systems. Different programming operations like COBOL (that is discussed on our other page) can be shown on <i>Linux- based mainframes.</i> Through the 1990s, <i>Linux</i> was created because it was not IBM. IBM and <i>Linux mainframes</i> were built from separate companies. <i>Linux mainframe</i> education is more popular today because it is simpler in its structural complex. Its recent creation allows for it to be accessible for updates for future generations of technology. There are also versions of <i>Linux</i> that can be used. These mainframes are just based on their operating system, and that is really what <i>Linux</i> is. It is essentially a system that is run though a mainframe, and some of these mainframes that they are run through include IBM. In conclusion, <i>Linux-based mainframes</i> are detailed upgraded versions of the IBM because of the <i>Linux operating system</i>, which allows it to be more current, organized, and easily accessible for today’s engineers and agencies.
