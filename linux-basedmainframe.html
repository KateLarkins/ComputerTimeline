    <h4>Linux is a mainframe operating system that uses a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel, which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals, and file systems (Source:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux") Its costs can be between 25K and 30K.</h4>

        <i>Linux-based mainframes</i> are mainframes that come from a system machine. These machines allow <i>Linux</i> to work. Some popular <i>Linux operating systems</i> used include Z machines. <i>Linux mainframes</i> were created as an advanced model of the original IBM mainframe. <i>Linux</i> is a “cleaner” version of mainframe that is structures to be organized and efficient. Through the 1990s, <i>Linux</i> was created because it was not IBM. IBM and <i>Linux mainframes</i> were built from separate companies. <i>Linux mainframe</i> education is more popular today because it is simpler in its structural complex. Its recent creation allows for it to be accessible for updates for future generations of technology. In conclusion, <i>Linux-based mainframes</i> are detailed upgraded versions of the IBM, which makes it more current, organized, and easily accessible for today’s engineers and agencies.
