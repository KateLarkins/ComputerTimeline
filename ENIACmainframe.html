    <h4>The ENIAC was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC) ENIAC mainframes cost from 4 million to 5 million dollars.</h4>

        The <i>ENIAC mainframe</i> was first created in 1945, but the idea first was presented in 1942 by John Mauchly. It came to be because of Mauchly and another man called Eckert (Eckert was hired to fulfill Mauchlyâ€™s visions). Programmers were needed to use the <i>ENIAC mainframe</i> because it was used for calculating numbers, similar to the original purpose of the first mainframe. It too, was used by the U.S. military to process how much artillery was being used at once. The U.S. military also originally funded the creation of this <i>mainframe</i> and asked college students to build it. <i>ENIAC</i> stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer. Although its name basically means a calculator, it was not always used for mathematical purposes. It was used for weather purposes (like thermal regulation and forecasts) The general public first found out about the ENIAC mainframe after World War two and it was classified during the wars because of its high technological abilities and performance. Due to its complex structure, a team supplied engineering to the <i>mainframe</i>. They also eventually updated unsuccessful vacuum tubes and created circuit guidelines for them) It was operated quickly, and its many parts did not get in the way of this (even though vacuum tubes failed at least once daily). The <i>ENIAC mainframe</i>, like the first mainframe was very large and has too been downsized since it was first built. <i>ENIAC mainframes</i> unfortunately do not run today, as manufacturing stopped for them in the early 1950s because it was no longer needed after the war.
