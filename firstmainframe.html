    <h4>The first mainframe was a computer used to bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. (Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) These mainframes initially costed around 15K.</h4>

        The <i>first mainframe</i> was created in the 1930s Howard Aiken (other results have mentioned a man named Harvard Mark I, who introduced the design to IBM, but this actually refers to the name of the device, which causes some confusion), which led to the creation of the <i>first mainframe</i>. The <i>first mainframe</i> was called the “Harvard Mark I” or the Harvard Machine in the early 1930s. After it was first created, it was nowhere near what it was supposed to be and it would continue to be changed and updated throughout the 1930s. Some argue that the <i>first mainframe</i> was actually IBM’s mainframe in the 1960s, but the original outline came from Harvard Mark I. The <i>first mainframe</i> was used for many purposes, and some of these purposes stray away from the typical businesses. They had then gone towards military use. The <i>first mainframe</i> had other names like Big Iron or supercomputers, and this was because of their tremendous sizes and weights. The <i>first mainframe</i> was essentially a big calculator that could process a lot of data at once, and this is why it was used by the military (through World War II). The idea of it loading bunches of data and create results quickly at once inspired future mainframes. It was put into more practical use later in the 1940s by IBM. IBM’s widespread influence brought upon the popularity of the <i>first mainframe</i>. It has been updated and continued to be used by business and even the government today.
