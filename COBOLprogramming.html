    <h4>It was a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) COBOL programmed mainframes cost $75,000.</h4>

        <i>COBOL Programming</i> was named by a group in New York, and they called it COmmon Business-Oriented Language. It is a computer business language used in mainframes that can run across many different computer platforms. Mainframes have languages that can calculate for mathematics, but <i>COBOL</i> specifically calculates business equations like data processing. It is used daily because it has progressed over the years. <i>COBOL</i> went under development in November 1959. It was originally created in 1959 because of an idea that a programmer named Mary Hawes had. Her idea was taken to the Pentagon to begin development and gain funding. Magnetic tape was used to make <i>COBOL</i> to run, and it was used by many different groups of people. IBM started using <i>COBOL</i> in the early 1960s. It is now being used globally with major businesses relying on <i>COBOL</i>. (It can also be run through Linux- refer to other page)

        Fun Fact: Did you know thereâ€™s a training program for <i>COBOL</i> on GitHub (through Visual Studio Code)? Due to demand in the need for technological workers, training programs have been set up for <i>COBOL</i> (because it is still heavily used today). Sometimes to become a Mainframe Developer, one has to learn languages like <i>COBOL</i>.
        When training to learn <i>COBOL</i>, you can find extensions online to use. Benefits of these extensions include a self-checking system, help with copybacks, organizing/cleaning up your code. It is very easy to learn this type of programming because there are online tutorials today that you can use.
