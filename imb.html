    <h4>IBM mainframes pocess up to 1 trillion web transactions daily and are known for their security reliability. IBM typically costs from 250K to 4 million dollars.</h4>

        <i>IBM mainframes</i> were created in the 1964s as gigantic computers that can hold and process a lot of information through their memory storage systems. Mainframes itself were considered <i>IBM</i> because there was no other big competition (so that is why they are sometimes just referred to as “The Mainframe”), and Harvard Mark I (refer back to first mainframe) was the first to develop them. They are capable of being a base port for operating systems like Linux and are designed to deal with arrangements of transactions (including those for the internet) between devices. They were created for the business world (e.g. banks, and government agencies), so that a machine could hold vast amounts of information. Memory in <i>IBM mainframes</i> can also be shared for easier sharing purposes. Specific <i>IBM mainframes</i> were designed to have protective security measures, as well as measures that prevent the machine itself from overloading. <i>IBM</i> software is constantly being updated and in current times, it has taken cyber-security to a serious level. People trust <i>IBM mainframes</i>, so they must work to insure that trust. At one point, a single IBM server weighed 5 tons, but over the years, the technology has downsized. <i>IBM mainframes</i> are worth… not much a fortune in today’s economy, but the first one cost $200,000. Some are more expensive based on what all they can perform and how they perform, but it is fairly easy to get one. Certain skills are required to work with IBM mainframes, and nowadays training to work in the subject is available. These people who work with <i>IBM mainframes</i> are called “mainframers”.
